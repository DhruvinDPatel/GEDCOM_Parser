This repository is created for the coursework assignment in SSW555-Agile Methods for Software Development
SSW555 is a course to learn, utilize, and implement agile methods in a team project

The team project contained in this repo is to develop a program used to identify errors and anomalies in GEDCOM files
GEDCOM is a standard format for genealogy data that identifies individuals and families in a three part line-oriented txt file

Errors, anomalies, and upcoming dates of characteristics in GEDCOM files are provided to users by the code in this repo
GEDCOM individual charactereristics: unique ID, name, gender, DOB, death date, unqie ID of spouse and children    
GEDCOM family characteritcs: unique ID of family, husband/wife, children as well as marriage/divorce date				

sample.ged is the GEDCOM file used for this project which has been colloborated on a shared familyecho.com account Several example GEDCOM files can be found online as well

parser_gedcom.py parses the sample.ged into a summary table and a useable format for UserStories.py
UserStories.py detects the mentioned errors, anomolies and noteable upcoming dates in a GEDCOM

User stories are provided by the professor in the beginning of the project and developed by the team in 2 week sprints
At the end of each sprint the team is responsible for providing examples of each user story

A burndown chart and sprint restrospective is completed at the each of each iteration as well

We genuinely hope viewers that come across this repository find it interesting and useful!
